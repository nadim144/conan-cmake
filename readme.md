# Chapter-1 Introduction to python

### Why python?
***
* Python is not a statically typed language, it is dynamically typed. 
* python is cross functional means program portability - porting program to new platform ussally need only cut and paste. This is true even for GUI, DB Access, Web programming, OS interfacing and Directory access.
* strong libray support from text matching to networking and vast collection of third-party libraries.
* very easy to component integration.

### Where is python used?
***
1. System programming
1. Building GUI application (using TkInter oe WxWidget framework)
1. Scripting program
1. Component Integration
1. Databse programming
1. Numeric and scientific application
1. Game programming
1. Robotics programming (CAN signal end-to-end testing using robotframework)

### What programming model does python supports?
***
**Answer**: python supports all **`4`** programming models
1. Function programming model
1. Procedural programming model
1. Object-oriented programming model
1. Event-driven programming model

# Chapter-2 Getting Started
There are different python implementations are:
- **`CPython`**: CPython is the reference implementation of the Python programming language, CPython compiles Python code into bytecode before interpreting it. It's compatible with various Python packages and modules
- **`PyPy`**: 
- **`Jython`**: 
- **`IronPython`**: 

All the implementations are compiler as well as interpreters. The compiler convert the python program into intermediate bytecode. Then the intepreter interprets this bytecode
